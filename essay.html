     <h2>Final Project</h2> 
        
        <p>My final project was a professional and personal profile/portfolio. My goal with this site is to use it as my own personal website to market my skills and talents. On it there are some facts about me, a little bio, some examples of my work, my new and emproved resume, and my social network/contact information. I think if I keep working on it and adding to it as I go, it will end up being a great resource for future employers. Not only this, but I can use it as somewhat of a scrapbook/hub for all my career and personal accomplishments. I think if I were able to put more time into it and learn how to code a little better it could turn out really well. </p>
        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        I used a lot of bootstrap components while designing the site. I also went back to codecademy for some help as well. I wanted it to be perfect, I am very detail oriented so the styling was definitely the most complicated for me. I also ended up looking at w3schools as well. I used a lot of divs and just tried to position them differently so that every page kind of flowed together but they didn't all look exactly the same. I wanted to mix it up but still keep it coordinated. I got to the point where I was typing so much and changing things so often that my hands cramped up and my head was getting fuzzy from staring at the screen so long. 
        
        
        <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
    I really enjoy my overall final project but I'm sure there are improvements to be made. I am just so happy with how far I've come over the semester. I'm no pro by any means but it's kind of cool to be able to say that I could code (a very basic) a website. I know that web design is not a very popular field for women. This project/course helped me realize that it is something I could see myself doing in the future, even if it's something as simple as alt text for images in SEO. That being said, this project also showed me how frustrating coding and web development can be. It still amazes me of all the websites out there that are so unique and each of them (at some point) had to be typed all out. Considering how long this very basic site took me, with much frustration, it's still amazes me that all of this comes from just typing out some codes. Not that it's a cell phone or food or anything, but it's something I think we take for granted because until this class I didn't realize the difficulty of the skill or the methods behind the madness (ex servers being slow or cell phone sites not responsive). This project helped me realize all of this because going into it I underestimated the amount of time it would take. Overall, I like my final project I just wish I was more skilled so it would look more professional. </div>
