    I found that this video was pretty dry and dull at times. Although very informative, I found that some of the information is outdated since it was from 2010. I would have loved to see something similar but a newer version. That being said, Wroblewski is very knowledgable about this topic, I just wish he showed a little more passion about it. He tried to be funny but it just didn't work very well because I don't think anyone caught the joke because they were daydreaming. Sorry Luke. I do think there are some segments that are still of great importance such as designing for mobile first because it mirrors what happens on the regular web. Jumping from site to site in quick short bursts. The need for quick and simple action is how consumers now interact, so constraints flaw the business. There are new ways of interacting that were never capable before and that will continue to happen as technology advances.

          <ol>
              <li>4% of Yelp customers use the Yelp app on their phone. That 4% is responsible for 30% of the total searches on Yelp.
              </li>
            <li> Once the iPhone came out in 2007, mobile became much easier to use to access the web. With ATT specifically, there was a ~5000% increase in mobile traffic.
                </li>
            
            <li>74% of people use phones when waiting in line.

         I enjoyed this video a little more than the first one. Not only was it shorter but Saffer was more passionate about his subject and was a better presenter. I loved his approach on design: focusing on the details. It's the little things that make a big difference. I found his story about the phone alarm going off during the symphony even though the phone was silenced to be very aparent because that has actually happened to me before. It's those little micro-interactions that people tend to overlook that greatly effect the overall user experience. Up until this video, I never realized how many micro-interactions make things either easier or more difficult in my everyday tasks. They are literally all around at all times of the day, and when the micro-interactions are bad that is almost always what I am complaining about when it comes to my personal mobile interactions.

        <ol><li>
    micro-interactions model to think about them and then think about designing them: trigger-> rules -> feedback -> loops and modes
            </li>
            <li> 
                If you write "I've attached" in your Gmail but don't send any attachments, Gmail will put a pop-up up before you send it to make sure you didn't forget to attach anything.

            <li>
                Examples of micro-interactions:logging in, changing a setting, swiping to unlock, favoriting or liking something, making a calendar event, adding a contact, etc.

              At first I was confused because he was speaking in a different language. Again I found this one kind of dry, I think because of it's length, but I liked his accent. In general I found his speech to be somewhat confusing. The idea of Conceptual Hallucination makes sense to me, but I don't necessarily see the point he was making. Although I do agree that tools and processes for the web need to change. Even just from this class I have realized how freaking difficult it is to make a site, let alone make one with an amazing design. My step-dad is the back-end web developer for Hershey Entertainment and Resorts and after taking this class I literally have no idea how he does it. I know I am only a beginner, but my sites are minimally viable and have taken so much time. They may be responsive but there are no design elements or fancy interactive capabilities. In that sense, I do feel that there needs to be a change in The Spirit of the Web.
