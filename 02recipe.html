    <h3>
Ingredients</h3>

          <ul>  <li>
1 whole wheat tortilla (or whole wheat pita bread)
    </li>

<li>
1/4 cup sauce (marinara, pesto, olive oil and garlic, barbecue sauce)
   </li>

 <li>1/3 cup or less shredded/crumbled cheese (mozzarella, cheddar, goat, feta)</li>
    <li>
Toppings (go wild!)
        </li></ul>

<h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
           
<ol><li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
    
        
<li>Place the tortilla in a 12-inch cast iron pan (see notes on baking surfaces below). Spread sauce evenly across the tortilla, leaving 1/2 inch around the edges. Sprinkle with cheese and toppings.
Place the tortilla in a 12-inch cast iron pan (see notes on baking surfaces below). Spread sauce evenly across the tortilla, leaving 1/2 inch around the edges. Sprinkle with cheese and toppings.
Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the cheese is golden and bubbling (no sooner!) and the edges of the tortilla are lightly browned. Slice and serve.</li></ol>

Notes
                </h3>
                <p>
If you don’t have a cast iron skillet I highly recommend getting one, but you can use an oven-safe baking rack or bake it directly on the rack of your toaster oven instead. Bake at 400 degrees for 8 to 11 minutes. Do not use a regular baking sheet because the bottom of the tortilla will not get crispy, your cheese will slide right off and you’ll wish you ordered out.

Although I have not tried it personally, Kim tried making tortilla pizzas in her cast iron skillet on a gas grill and said they turned out great!
Make sure to check the ingredients list on the whole wheat tortillas. It should list about 5 ingredients, not 25. I buy mine at health food stores and store them in the fridge or freezer and they almost never go bad.

<h3>Topping ideas:</h3>
                <p>
<em>As shown</em>: barbecue sauce (trust me), fresh mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheese, chopped red onion, sliced fresh jalapeño, fresh or defrosted frozen pineapple (canned pineapple is not as good).</p>
<p>
Basil pesto, feta, fresh or roasted bell peppers (jarred is fine), sliced kalamata olives, chopped red onion, sliced cherry tomatoes.
                    </p>
                <p>
Arugula pesto, basil pesto or light marinara sauce, mozzarella (optional), fresh arugula and parmesan shavings added after baking (like this).
                    </p>
                <p>
Red pepper pesto and goat cheese.
                    </p>
                <p>
